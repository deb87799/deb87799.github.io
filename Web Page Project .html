	<tr> <td> Hi! My name is Dawson Britt and I grew up in Snellville, GA. 
	I haved lived in Georgia my whole life, and all of my family is from Georiga. 
I went to Brookwood Highschool in Snellville, after having been in that school district for my whole life. 
In highschool I was involved in many things around the school. 
I played on the baseball team, while also being a part of many clubs. 
Some of the clubs I was in include SGA, Outdoors Club, and Brookwood Leadership Team. It has been my goal as long as I can remember to get into UGA, 
and I did everything I could to make that goal happen. </td>

	<tr> <th colspan="2"> My Life as a Dawg </th> </tr>
	<tr> <td> I am a freshman here at UGA and so far I have enjoyed every minute of it. I am an Agriculture and Applied Economics major, and plan 
	to get a graduate degree in order to hopefully work for the government. I would like to work in the country's agricultural department. 
	I am working to start getting involved around the school. I would like to join as many clubs as I can and make a difference around campus. I plan on becoming a part of SGA as I 
	feel like it will be a good way to make a positive impact at the school. I also take part in intramural sports as it is a good way to meet new people, and for me to participate 
	in sports I enjoy.

	<tr> <th colspan="2"> My Favorite Things About UGA </th> </tr>
	<tr> <td colspan="2"> Of course I enjoy the football at UGA and the other sports the school has to offer. However, I also enjoy the community of the school itself. Everyone is friendly to everyone and it creates a 
atmosphere that helps you feel at home. The campus was fairly easy to learn and it provides me with everything I would ever need to me succesful.
Athens itself is a great college town and is big enough to satisfy all of my needs. Downtown has a wide variety of shops and restuarants that keep things
from getting stale. I would not have wanted to go anywhere else, and I am very happy with my decision to come to God's favorite university. </td>
